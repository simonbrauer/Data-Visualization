##Maps

Maps can be really useful, but introduce a lot of bias in the visual structure of the image. For example, many/most maps end up just being population density maps.

```{r}
library(statebins)
dat <- read.csv("http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/business/states-most-threatened-by-trade/states.csv?cache=1", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
p <- statebins(dat, "state", "avgshare94_00", breaks = 4, 
                labels = c("0-1", "1-2", "2-3", "3-4"),
                legend_title = "Share of workforce with jobs or threatened by trade", font_size = 3)
                
p + theme(legend.position = "bottom") + 
  ggtitle("1994-2000")
```
